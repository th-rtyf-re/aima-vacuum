# AIMA Vacuum cleaner
---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
This `Python` code simulates a vacuum cleaner in a grid-shaped world and uses
search algorithms to explore the world and clean it. This code was written in
the context of an AI course.

The code `vacuum.py` comes with some examples. Comment or uncomment the final
lines of the code to run various calls to the function `random_simulation`.

Happy cleaning!
