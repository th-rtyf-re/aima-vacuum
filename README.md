# AIMA Vacuum cleaner

This `Python` code simulates a vacuum cleaner in a grid-shaped world and uses
search algorithms to explore the world and clean it. This code was written in
the context of an AI course.

The code `vacuum.py` comes with some examples. Comment or uncomment the final
lines of the code and run `python vacuum.py` in console to observe various
calls to the function `random_simulation`. If you are running the code in some
other environment, you may need to call `random_simulation` yourself. See the
code for the documentation.

Happy cleaning!
